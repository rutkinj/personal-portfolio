      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Joe Rutkin. I'm a Java developer. Before studying software development, I spent five years as a cheesemonger, building relationships with customers and colleagues. During this time, I gained expertise in my interpersonal skill set; honing my listening ability and becoming adept at identifying the needs of both my customers and co-workers. I've always been interested in problem solving and finding elegant solutions to complex problems, so, along with a lifelong interest in technology, software development was a logical next step for me. Through this change, I hope to find a career filled with interesting challenges and more room to grow personally and professionally. Thank you ðŸ’œ",
